========= Testing of calcite_GIA with different time stepping settings =========

A is the time to formulate calculate linear system. 
B is the time to formulate and calculate global system. 
C is the time to calculate all local problems ones. 

let D = B + C; 

98 steps * 3 etas * A  +  98 steps * 5 iterations * ( B + C) = 41 sec
40 steps * 3 etas * A  +  40 steps * 10 iterations * (B + C) = 27 sec

so, 

294 A + 490 D = 41  ... (1)
120 A + 400 D = 27  ... (2)

(2) * 2.5 :

300 A + 1000 D = 67.5 ... (3)
300 A + 500  D = 42   ... (4) approx. (1)

(3) - (4) : 
500 D = 25.5
we take D = 0.05

back substitute into (3): 
300 A + 50 = 67.5
A = 0.058 

back check (2): 
120 * 0.058 + 400 * 0.05 = 6.96 + 20 = 26.96 very close to 27! 

As a conclusion, we have figured out: 
A, as the time to formulate and calculate one linear system is about 0.058 sec. 
D, as the time to formulate and calculate one global non-linear system with the local problem, is about 0.05 sec.
